## Document Control Workflow

Implement document control from creation through obsolescence:

1. Assign document number per numbering procedure
2. Create document using controlled template
3. Route for review to required reviewers
4. Address review comments and document responses
5. Obtain required approval signatures
6. Assign effective date and distribute
7. Update Document Master List
8. **Validation:** Document accessible at point of use; obsolete versions removed

### Document Lifecycle Stages

| Stage | Definition | Actions Required |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| Draft | Under creation or revision | Author editing, not for use |
| Review | Circulated for review | Reviewers provide feedback |
| Approved | All signatures obtained | Ready for training/distribution |
| Effective | Training complete, released | Available for use |
| Superseded | Replaced by newer revision | Remove from active use |
| Obsolete | No longer applicable | Archive per retention schedule |

### Document Types and Prefixes

| Prefix | Document Type | Typical Content |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| QM | Quality Manual | QMS overview, scope, policy |
| SOP | Standard Operating Procedure | Process-level procedures |
| WI | Work Instruction | Task-level step-by-step |
| TF | Template/Form | Controlled forms |
| SPEC | Specification | Product/process specs |
| PLN | Plan | Quality/project plans |

### Required Reviewers by Document Type

| Document Type | Required Reviewers | Required Approvers |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| SOP | Process Owner, QA | QA Manager, Process Owner |
| WI | Area Supervisor, QA | Area Manager |
| SPEC | Engineering, QA | Engineering Manager, QA |
| TF | Process Owner | QA |
| Design Documents | Design Team, QA | Design Control Authority |

## Document Numbering System

Assign consistent document numbers for identification and retrieval.

### Numbering Format

Standard format: `PREFIX-CATEGORY-SEQUENCE[-REVISION]`

```
Example: SOP-02-001-A

SOP = Document type (Standard Operating Procedure)
02  = Category code (Document Control)
001 = Sequential number
A   = Revision indicator
```
