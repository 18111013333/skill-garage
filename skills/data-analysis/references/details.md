### 5. Brief every result in decision format
- Every output should include the answer, evidence, confidence, caveats, and recommended next action.
- If the output is going to a stakeholder, translate the method into business implications instead of leading with technical detail.

### 6. Stress-test claims before recommending action
- Segment by obvious confounders, compare the right baseline, quantify uncertainty, and check sensitivity to exclusions or time windows.
- Strong-looking numbers without robustness checks are not decision-ready.

### 7. Escalate when the data cannot support the claim
- Block or downgrade conclusions when sample size is weak, the source is unreliable, definitions drifted, or confounding is unresolved.
- It is better to say "unknown yet" than to produce false confidence.

## Common Traps

- Reusing a KPI name after changing numerator, denominator, or exclusions -> trend comparisons become invalid.
- Comparing daily, weekly, and monthly grains in one chart -> movement looks real but is mostly aggregation noise.
- Showing percentages without underlying counts -> leadership overreacts to tiny denominators.
- Using a pretty chart instead of the right chart -> the output looks polished but hides the actual decision signal.
- Hunting for interesting cuts after seeing the result -> narrative follows chance instead of evidence.
- Shipping automated reports without metric owners or caveats -> bad numbers spread faster than they can be corrected.
- Treating observational patterns as causal proof -> action plans get built on correlation alone.

## Approach Selection

| Question type | Approach | Key output |
|---------------|----------|------------|
| "Is X different from Y?" | Hypothesis test | p-value + effect size + CI |
| "What predicts Z?" | Regression/correlation | Coefficients + R² + residual check |
| "How do users behave over time?" | Cohort analysis | Retention curves by cohort |
| "Are these groups different?" | Segmentation | Profiles + statistical comparison |
| "What's unusual?" | Anomaly detection | Flagged points + context |

For technique details and when to use each, see `techniques.md`.

## Output Standards

1. **Lead with the insight**, not the methodology
2. **Quantify uncertainty** - ranges, not point estimates
3. **State limitations** - what this analysis can't tell you
4. **Recommend next steps** - what would strengthen the conclusion

## Red Flags to Escalate

- User wants to "prove" a predetermined conclusion
- Sample size too small for reliable inference
- Data quality issues that invalidate analysis
- Confounders that can't be controlled for

## External Endpoints

This skill makes no external network requests.

| Endpoint | Data Sent | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| None | None | N/A |

No data is sent externally.

## Security & Privacy

Data that leaves your machine:
- Nothing by default.

Data that stays local:
- Nothing by default.

This skill does NOT:
- Access undeclared external endpoints.
- Store credentials or raw exports in hidden local memory files.
- Create or depend on local folder systems for persistence.
- Create automations or background jobs without explicit user confirmation.
- Rewrite its own instruction source files.
